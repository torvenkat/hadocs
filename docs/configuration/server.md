I repurposed an old Mac Mini (*circa 2014*). 

* Dual-core Intel i5 (Haswell ULT), at 2.7 GHz
* 4 GB RAM
* 1 TB SSD (Samsung SSD 860 QVO)

It runs [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve), an open-source Virtualization Platform, on a skeletal Debian.  The Home Assistant runs in a container, with no restrictions on CPU, Memory, or disk space utilization. Along with this I run [WeeWx weather server](http://www.weewx.com/)  on  another.
